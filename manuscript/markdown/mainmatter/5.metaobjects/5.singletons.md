## Singleton Prototypes

In classic JavaScript, we delegate object behaviour to prototypes. Typically, prototypes are used for *shared* object behaviour:

    var RectanglePrototype = extend(Object.create(null), {
      area: function () {
        return this.length * this.width;
      },
      isaSquare: function () {
        return this.length === this.width;
      }
    });

    var twoByThree = extend(Object.create(RectanglePrototype), {
      length: 2,
      width: 3
    });

    var fourByFour = extend(Object.create(RectanglePrototype), {
      length: 4,
      width: 4
    });

    twoByThree.area()
      //=> 6

    fourByFour.area()
      //=> 16

There is a problem with this approach. What happens when we want to customize the behaviour of one object?

    fourByFour.isaJeep = function () { return false; }

    fourByFour
      //=>
        { length: 4,
          width: 4,
          isaJeep: [Function] }

Once agin, we're mixing behaviour with domain properties. We can make `isaJeep` non-enumerable, but having embraced the idea of separating behaviour from domain properties with a prototype, why not use a prototype here? The trick is to create a unique prototype for *every* object.

Like this:

    var fourByFour = (function () {
      var SingletonPrototype = Object.create(RectanglePrototype);

      return extend(Object.create(SingletonPrototype), {
        length: 4,
        width: 4
      });
    })();

`SingletonPrototype` is an empty object that delegates to `RectanglePrototype`, but no object except `fourByFour` delegates to `SingletonPrototype`. We can rewrite it more simply:

    var fourByFour = extend(
      Object.create(Object.create(RectanglePrototype)),
      {
        length: 4,
        width: 4
      }
    );

Now when we want to bind behaviour to `fourByFour`, we can write:

    Object.getPrototypeOf(fourByFour).isaJeep = function () { return false; }

    fourByFour
      //=> { length: 4, width: 4 }

    fourByFour.isaJeep()
      //=> false

When a prototype exists solely to manage behaviour for a single object, we call it a *singleton prototype*. It's a specific case of a *singleton metaobject*. JavaScript is agnostic about singleton metaobjects, it's up to you whether to use them.

A> Other languages have support for singleton metaobjects baked in. For example, in Ruby you can define a method specific to an object:
A>
A>     obj = Object.new
A>     def obj.ect
A>       'Object'
A>     end
A>
A> Behind the scenes, Ruby creates a "singleton class" just for `obj` and then defines the method in the singleton class. We can see this:
A>
A>     obj.singleton_class.instance_methods - Object.methods
A>       #=> [:ect]
