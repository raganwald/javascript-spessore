As we discussed earlier, the idea behind metaobject-2s is to organize the way we program our objects and classes using the same tools we use to program our domain objects.

Namely, objects that manage their own internal state and respond to requests using methods. The semantics we create and the methods we expose comprise a *protocol*, and the standard phrase for developing our own programmable metaobject-2 system is to build a *metaobject protocol*.
