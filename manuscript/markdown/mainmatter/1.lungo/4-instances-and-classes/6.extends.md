## Extending Objects with Inheritance {#classextension}

You recall from [Composition and Extension](#extensible) that we extended a Plain Old JavaScript Queue to create a Plain Old JavaScript Deque. But what if we have decided to use JavaScript's prototypes and the `new` keyword instead of Plain Old JavaScript Objects? How do we extend a queue into a deque?

Here's our `Queue`:

    var Queue = function () {
      extend(this, {
        array: [],
        head: 0,
        tail: -1
      })
    };

    extend(Queue.prototype, {
      pushTail: function (value) {
        return this.array[this.tail += 1] = value
      },
      pullHead: function () {
        var value;

        if (!this.isEmpty()) {
          value = this.array[this.head]
          this.array[this.head] = void 0;
          this.head += 1;
          return value
        }
      },
      isEmpty: function () {
        return this.tail < this.head
      }
    });

And here's what our `Deque` would look like before we wire things together:

    var Dequeue = function () {
      Queue.call(this);
    };

    Dequeue.INCREMENT = 4;

    extend(Dequeue.prototype, {
      size: function () {
        return this.tail - this.head + 1
      },
      pullTail: function () {
        var value;

        if (!this.isEmpty()) {
          value = this.array[this.tail];
          this.array[this.tail] = void 0;
          this.tail -= 1;
          return value
        }
      },
      pushHead: function (value) {
        var i;

        if (this.head === 0) {
          for (i = this.tail; i >= this.head; --i) {
            this.array[i + INCREMENT] = this.array[i]
          }
          this.tail += this.constructor.INCREMENT;
          this.head += this.constructor.INCREMENT
        }
        this.array[this.head -= 1] = value
      }
    });

A> We obviously want to do all of a `Queue`'s initialization, thus we called `Queue.call(this)`.

So what do we want from dequeues such that we can call all of a `Queue`'s methods as well as a `Dequeue`'s? Should we copy everything from `Queue.prototype` into `Deque.prototype`, like `extend(Deque.prototype, Queue.prototype)`? That would work, except for one thing: If we later modified `Queue`, say by mixing in some new methods into its prototype, those wouldn't be picked up by `Dequeue`.

No, there's a better idea. Prototypes are objects, right? Why must they be Plain Old JavaScript Objects? Can't a prototype be an *instance*?

Yes they can. Imagine that `Deque.prototype` was a proxy for an instance of `Queue`. It would, of course, have all of a queue's behaviour through `Queue.prototype`. We don't want it to be an *actual* instance, mind you. It probably doesn't matter with a queue, but some of the things we might work with might make things awkward if we make random instances. A database connection comes to mind, we may not want to create one just for the convenience of having access to its behaviour.

Here's such a proxy:

    var queueProxy = new Queue();

And here's another:

    var queueProxy = Object.create(Queue.prototype);

The key here is that the prototype of a `Dequeue` needs to be an object that has its prototype set to `Queue.prototype`. That way, we can add methods to `Dequeue`'s prototype without modifying `Queue`'s prototype. Let's double-check:

    Queue.prototype.isPrototypeOf(queueProxy)
      //=> true

Let's insert `queueProxy` into our code:

    var Dequeue = function () {
      Queue.call(this)
    };

    Dequeue.INCREMENT = 4;

    Dequeue.prototype = queueProxy;

    extend(Dequeue.prototype, {
      size: function () {
        return this.tail - this.head + 1
      },
      pullTail: function () {
        var value;

        if (!this.isEmpty()) {
          value = this.array[this.tail];
          this.array[this.tail] = void 0;
          this.tail -= 1;
          return value
        }
      },
      pushHead: function (value) {
        var i;

        if (this.head === 0) {
          for (i = this.tail; i >= this.head; --i) {
            this.array[i + INCREMENT] = this.array[i]
          }
          this.tail += this.constructor.INCREMENT;
          this.head += this.constructor.INCREMENT
        }
        this.array[this.head -= 1] = value
      }
    });

And it seems to work:

    d = new Dequeue()
    d.pushTail('Hello')
    d.pushTail('JavaScript')
    d.pushTail('!')
    d.pullHead()
      //=> 'Hello'
    d.pullTail()
      //=> '!'
    d.pullHead()
      //=> 'JavaScript'

Wonderful!

### extracting the boilerplate

Let's turn our mechanism into a function:

    var child = function (parent, child) {
      var proxy = Object.create(parent.prototype);
      child.prototype = proxy;
      return child;
    }

And use it in `Dequeue`:

    var Dequeue = child(Queue, function () {
      Queue.call(this)
    });

    Dequeue.INCREMENT = 4;

    extend(Dequeue.prototype, {
      size: function () {
        return this.tail - this.head + 1
      },
      pullTail: function () {
        var value;

        if (!this.isEmpty()) {
          value = this.array[this.tail];
          this.array[this.tail] = void 0;
          this.tail -= 1;
          return value
        }
      },
      pushHead: function (value) {
        var i;

        if (this.head === 0) {
          for (i = this.tail; i >= this.head; --i) {
            this.array[i + INCREMENT] = this.array[i]
          }
          this.tail += this.constructor.INCREMENT;
          this.head += this.constructor.INCREMENT
        }
        this.array[this.head -= 1] = value
      }
    });

### future directions

Some folks just **love** to build their own mechanisms. When all goes well, they become famous as framework creators and open source thought leaders. When all goes badly they create in-house proprietary one-offs that blur the line between application and framework with abstractions everywhere.

If you're keen on learning, you can work on improving the above code to handle extending constructor properties, automatically calling the parent constructor function, and so forth. Or you can decide that doing it by hand isn't that hard so why bother putting a thin wrapper around it?

It's up to you, while JavaScript isn't the tersest language, it isn't so baroque that building inheritance ontologies requires hundreds of lines of inscrutable code.
