## The Class Class {#classclass}

In [The "I" Word](#iword), we discussed how the word "inheritance" is used, loosely, to refer to either or both of membership in a formal class ("is-a"), and delegation of implementation and expectations ("was-a"). Given our code for initializing metaobjects:

    constructor: function (superclass) {
      if (superclass != null && superclass.prototype != null) {
        this.prototype = Object.create(superclass.prototype);
      }
      else this.prototype = Object.create(null);
    }

This sets up the prototype chain for instances. For example, a special subclass of `QuadTree` for trees of trees that supports interpolating `n`, `e`, `s`, `w`, and `c`:

    var TreeOfTrees = Class.create(QuadTree);

    TreeOfTrees.defineMethod('n', function () {
      return this.ne.constructor.create(this.nw.ne, this.ne.nw, this.ne.sw, this.nw.se);
    }).defineMethod('e', function () {
      return this.ne.constructor.create(this.ne.sw, this.ne.se, this.se.ne, this.se.nw);
    })
    // ...

Instances of `TreeOfTrees` inherit the methods defined in `TreeOfTrees` as well as those in `QuadTree`. Although this technique can be overused, it is a useful option for sharing behaviour.

Obviously, implementation inheritance allows two classes to share a common superclass, and thus share behaviour between them. What about classes themselves? As described, they are all instances of `Class`, but that is not a hard and fast requirement.

### fluent interfaces {#fluentclass}

Consider [fluent interfaces][fluent]. In software engineering, a fluent interface (as first coined by Eric Evans and Martin Fowler) is an implementation of an object oriented API that aims to provide for more readable code.

[fluent]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface

Object and instance methods can be bifurcated into two classes: Those that query something, and those that update something. Most design philosophies arrange things such that update methods return the value being updated. However, the [fluent] style presumes that most of the time when you perform an update, you are more interested in doing other things with the receiver then the values being passed as argument(s), so the rule is to return the receiver unless the method is a query.

So, given:

    var MutableQuadTree = Class.create(BasicObjectClass);

We might write:

    MutableQuadTree
      .defineMethod( 'setNW', function (value) {
        this.nw = value;
        return this;
      })
      .defineMethod( 'setNE', function (value) {
        this.ne = value;
        return this;
      })
      .defineMethod( 'setSE', function (value) {
        this.se = value;
        return this;
      })
      .defineMethod( 'setSW', function (value) {
        this.sw = value;
        return this;
      });

This would be a fluent interface, allowing us to write things like:

    var tree = MutableQuadTree
                .create()
                  .setNW(Cell.create(1))
                  .setNE(Cell.create(0))
                  .setSE(Cell.create(0))
                  .setSW(Cell.create(01);

However, what work it is! Another possibility would be to subclass `Class`, and override `defineMethod`, like so:

    var allong = require('allong.es');
    var unvariadic = allong.es.unvariadic;

    var FluentClass = Class.create(Class);

    FluentClass.defineMethod( 'defineMethod', function (name, body) {
      this.prototype[name] = unvariadic(body.length, function () {
        var returnValue = body.apply(this, arguments);
        if (typeof(returnValue) === 'undefined') {
          return this;
        }
        else return returnValue;
      });
      return this;
    });

A normal method semantics are that if it doesn't explicitly return a value, it returns `undefined`. A `FluentClass` method's semantics are that if it doesn't explicitly return a value, it returns the receiver. So now, we can write:

    var MutableQuadTree = FluentClass.create(BasicObjectClass);

    MutableQuadTree
      .defineMethod( 'setNW', function (value) {
        this.nw = value;
      })
      .defineMethod( 'setNE', function (value) {
        this.ne = value;
      })
      .defineMethod( 'setSE', function (value) {
        this.se = value;
      })
      .defineMethod( 'setSW', function (value) {
        this.sw = value;
      });

    var tree = MutableQuadTree
      .create()
        .setNW(Cell.create(1))
        .setNE(Cell.create(0))
        .setSE(Cell.create(0))
        .setSW(Cell.create(01);

And our trees are *fluent by default*: Any method that doesn't explicitly return a value with the `return` keyword will return the receiver.

By creating classes that share their own implementation of `defineMethod`, we now have a way to create collections of objects that have their own special semantics. There are many ways to do this, of course, but the key idea here is that we're using polymorphism: Fluent classes look just like regular classes, so there is no need to write any special code when defining a fluent method or creating an object with fluent semantics.

We're using the exact same techniques for programming with metaclasses that we use for programming with domain objects.
