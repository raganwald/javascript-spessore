## Interlude: "is-a" and "was-a"

Words like "delegate" are carefully chosen to say nothing about semantic relationships. Given:

~~~~~~~~
function C () {}

C.prototype.iAm = function () { return "a C"; };

var a = new C();

a.iAm();
  //=> 'a C'

a instanceof C
  //=> true
~~~~~~~~

We can say that the entity `a` delegates handling of the method `iAm` to its prototype. But what is the relationship between `a` and `C`? What is this "instance of?"

In programming, there are two major kinds relationships between entities and metaobjects (be those metaobjects mixins, classes, prototypes, or anything else). First, there is a semantic relationship. We call this **is-a**. If we say that `a` is-a `C`, we are saying that there is some valuable meaning to the idea that there is a set of all `C`s and that `a` belonging to that set matters.

The second is an implementation relationship. We have various names for this depending on how we implement things. We can say `a` delegates-to `C`. We can say `a` uses `C`. We sometimes arrange things so that `a` is-composed-of mixin `M`.

When we have an implementation relationship, we are saying that there is no meaningful set of entities, the relationship is purely one of convenience. Sometimes, we use physical inheritance, like a prototype, but we don't care about a semantic relationship, it's simply a mechanism for sharing some behaviour.

When we use inheritance but don't care about semantics, we call the relationship **was-a**. `a` was-a `C` means that we are not asserting that it is meaningful to say that `a` is a member of the set of all `C`s.

Semantic typing is all about "is-a," whereas structural typing is all about "was-a."

A> My cargo bug is-a beetle. It's recognizable as a beetle. And everywhere I could use a beetle, I can use my cargo bug. This is the is-a relationship of programming, there is some set of functions, and they we are saying that they are valid for all "b" where "b is-a beetle." My cargo bug is a beetle, so we know that our functions are valid when they operate on it.

A> Now I buy another beetle, but I rip off the bodywork and build a completely different car out of it, a Dune Buggy:

A> A dune buggy is not a beetle. It doesn't look like a beetle. It *was* a beetle, but now it's a dune buggy. "was-a" is a relationship that describes one object using another object for its implementation, but there is no equivalence implied. "was-a" is a relationship of convenience.
