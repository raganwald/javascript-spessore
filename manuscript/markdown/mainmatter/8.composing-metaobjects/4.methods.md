## Overriding and Specializing Methods {#specializing-methods}

Many languages, including JavaScript, implement "override by default." When you assign a function to a property in a prototype, you overwrite whatever method may have been previously bound to that property in the prototype, and you override any method bound to that property higher in the prototype chain.

When that's what we want to do, we're free to resolve the methods we wish to override with `{override: 'someMethod'}` But we also have the option to extend methods with `before`, `after`, and `around`.

Up to now, we've considered resolving conflicts as a way to handle the case when two behaviours both have a method with the same name, and both methods are roughly equal in importance. This is the case when an `initialize` method conflicts. But sometimes, we have behaviour that is intended to extend another behaviour's implementation of a method.

For example, if someone has children and has a parent, then adding to their children also adds their parent's grandchildren:

~~~~~~~~
var HasChildren = encapsulate({
  initialize: function () {
    this._children = [];
    return this;
  },
  addChild: function (name) {
    this._children.push(name);
    return this;
  },
  children: function () {
    return this._children;
  }
});

var HasGrandchildren = encapsulate({
  initialize: function () {
    this._grandchildren = [];
    return this;
  },
  addGrandchild: function (name) {
    this._grandchildren.push(name);
    return this;
  },
  grandchildren: function () {
    return this._grandchildren;
  }
});

var HasParent = encapsulate({
  addParent: function (parent) {
    this._parent = parent;
    return this;
  },

  addChild: function (name) {
    this._parent.addGrandchild(name);
  }
});

var gwen = Object.create(HasGrandchildren).initialize(),
    IsParentAndChild = composeBehaviours(
      HasChildren,
      resolve(HasParent, {addChild: 'after'})
    ),
    reg = Object.create(IsParentAndChild).initialize();

reg.addParent(gwen);
reg.addChild('Clara');
reg.addChild('Thomas');

gwen.grandchildren()
  //=> [ 'Clara', 'Thomas' ]
~~~~~~~~

*TODO: First write addChild where we repeat ourselves, then write the decoration version*

The general model of children, parents and grandchildren is flawed, but for the moment let's look at what's wrong with the code for implementing the behaviour and not the behaviour itself. `HasParent.addChild` clearly makes no sense on its own, it exists to "decorate" `HasChildren.addChild`.

So we always have to write `resolve(HasParent, {addChild: 'after'})`. This is error-prone. Furthermore, there is no way to check that we actually are decorating a method that already exists. What if we forget?

Instead, let's directly write `HasParent` with the resolution "baked in:"

~~~~~~~~
var HasParent = {
  addParent: function (parent) {
    this._parent = parent;
    return this;
  },

  addChild: {after: function (name) {
    this._parent.addGrandchild(name);
  }}
}

var IsParentAndChild = composeBehaviours(HasChildren, HasParent),
    gwen = Object.create(HasGrandchildren).initialize(),
    reg = Object.create(IsParentAndChild).initialize();

reg.addParent(gwen);
reg.addChild('Clara');
reg.addChild('Thomas');

gwen.grandchildren()
  //=> [ 'Clara', 'Thomas' ]
~~~~~~~~

This version of `AddParent` does not need `resolve`. We did not do this with methods like `HasChildren` above, because they made sense on their own. But as we've written it, `HasParent` must always decorate an `addChild` method, so it makes sense to write the resolution directly into the behaviour.

Furthermore, we now have a way of checking that we are composing HasParent with behaviour that already defines `addChild`:

~~~~~~~~
var HasGrandchildrenAndParent = composeBehaviours(HasGrandchildren, HasParent)
  //=> 'addChild' is not conflicted, but was given a resolution
~~~~~~~~

This is very helpful, as it prevents us from making a mistake. Our implementation *expects* to decorate `addChild`, so it's a good thing that `composeBehaviours` detects the problem.

*TODO: write a closure checker that works on a single behaviour*

### resolving methods by name

There are other ways to "signal" that we want certain methods to decorate existing methods. Many frameworks use naming conventions. We could, for example, design things so that if we write `save`, we want a save method, but if we write `afterSave`, we want to decorate an existing `save` method:

~~~~~~~~
function resolveByName (behaviour) {
  var result = Object.create(null);

  Object.keys(behaviour).forEach(function (methodName) {
    var resolver = Object.keys(policies).reduce(function (acc, policy) {
      if (Object.keys(acc).length === 0) {
        var regex = new RegExp("^" + policy + "([A-Z])(.*)$"),
            actualMethodName;
        if (md = methodName.match(regex)) {
          actualMethodName = md[1].toLowerCase() + md[2];
          acc[actualMethodName] = {};
          acc[actualMethodName][policy] = behaviour[methodName];
        }
      }
      return acc;
    }, Object.create(null));
    if (Object.keys(resolver).length === 0) {
      result[methodName] = behaviour[methodName];
    }
    else extend(result, resolver);
  });

  return result;
}

var LogsSave = resolveByName({
  toString: undefined,

  beforeSave: function () {
    console.log("saving " + this.toString());
  }
})
  //=>
    { toString: undefined,
      save: { before: [Function] } }
~~~~~~~~

"Resolve" is a bit of a misnomer when we're writing behaviour that specializes other behaviour. We're really *decorating* behaviour. Programmers in some communities call it "stacking" behaviour:

*TODO: Sketch of stacked behaviour.*

Stacking behaviour can be used when one behaviour specializes or enhances another. It can also be used when two behaviours are orthogonal, but need to interact. Organizing object-oriented software around orthogonal responsibilities that interact at the method level is called "Aspect-Oriented Software Development."

### aspect-oriented software development

I> In computing, Aspect-oriented software development (AOSD) is an emerging software development technology that seeks new modularizations of software systems in order to isolate secondary or supporting functions from the main program's business logic.
I>
I>--[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_software_development)

Every entity should have a primary responsibility. For example, a `Songwriter`'s responsibility is to manage its songs:

~~~~~~~~
var Songwriter = encapsulate({
  initialize: function () {
    this._songs = [];
    return this;
  },
  addSong: function (name) {
    this._songs.push(name);
    return this;
  },
  songs: function () {
    return this._songs;
  }
});
~~~~~~~~

Secondary responsibilities are often orthogonal concerns. Waving aside ECMAScript-6's [`Object.observe`][observe] for a moment, we could design a program that has views that are notified when models that delegate to `Songwriter` are changed. We would start with the basic idea that something like a view could "subscribe" to a model that is a `Subscribable`:

[observe]: http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:observe

~~~~~~~~
var Subscribable = encapsulate({
  initialize: function () {
    this.subscribers = [];
    return this;
  },
  subscribe: function (callback) {
    this.subscribers.push(callback);
  },
  unsubscribe: function (callback) {
    this.subscribers = this.subscribers.filter( function (subscriber) {
      return subscriber !== callback;
    });
  },
  notify: function () {
    this.subscribers.forEach( function (subscriber) {
      subscriber.call(this, arguments);
    });
  }
});
~~~~~~~~

We can make a Songwriter "subscribable," and fake up a view to test it:

~~~~~~~~
var sweetBabyJames = Object.create(composeBehaviours(
  Songwriter,
  resolve( Subscribable, {initialize: 'after'} ),
  resolveByName(
    encapsulate({
      notify: undefined,
      afterAddSong: function () { return this.notify(); }
    })
  )
)).initialize();

function englishList (list) {
  var butLast = list.slice(0, list.length - 1),
      last = list[list.length - 1];
  return butLast.length > 0
         ? [butLast.join(', '), last].join(' and ')
         : last;
}

var SongwriterView = {
  initialize: function (model, name) {
    this.model = model;
    this.name = name;
    this.model.subscribe(this.render.bind(this));
    return this;
  },
  render: function () {
    var songList  = this.model.songs().length > 0
                    ? [" has written " + englishList(this.model.songs().map(function (song) {
                        return "'" + song + "'"; }))]
                    : [];

    console.log(this.name + songList);
    return this;
  }
}

var jamesView = Object.create(SongwriterView).initialize(sweetBabyJames, 'James Taylor');

sweetBabyJames.addSong('Fire and Rain')
  //=> James Taylor has written 'Fire and Rain'
       {}
~~~~~~~~

We can see that the `sweetBabyJames` object has two orthogonal concerns. The primary concern is managing the artist's songs, while the secondary concern is allowing other objects to subscribe to its updates. Interaction between the two is handled by decorating the primary concern's methods with "after-methods."

A> Aspect-Oriented Programming and Aspect-Oriented Software Development is a far, far richer idea than simply wiring orthogonal behaviours to each other with method decoration. We are simply using this "aspect" of it to explore method decoration.

### specialization and prototype chains

Our scheme for decorating methods with specialization like `afterAddSong: function () { return this.notify(); }` works perfectly when we're composing behaviour. This works in concert with prototypes when we're building a single prototype.

What this scheme *can't* do is compose behaviour across prototypes. Although we prefer to avoid creating elaborate prototype chains, let's presume that we have an excellent reason for wanting to create an `Songwriter` prototype, and also create a `SubscribableSongwriter` prototype that delegrates to `AwardWinningSongwriter`.

In other words:

![A small prototype chain](images/8/chain.png)

Now we want to make a `SubscribableAwardWinningSongwriter` that delegates to `AwardWinningSongwriter`. There is a trick for making behaviour that delegates to a prototype: We compose the behaviour we want with an object that delegates to the desired prototype. In effect, we're composing the delegation with the behvaiour we want.

~~~~~~~~
var SubscribableSongwriter = composeBehaviours(
  Object.create(Songwriter),
  resolve( Subscribable, {initialize: 'after'} ),
  resolveByName(
    encapsulate({
      notify: undefined,
      afterAddSong: function () { return this.notify(); }
    })
  )
);
~~~~~~~~

We have what we need to build our object:

~~~~~~~~
var paulSimon = Object.create(SubscribableAwardWinningSongwriter).initialize(),
    paulView  = Object.create(SongwriterView).initialize(paulSimon, 'Paul Simon');

paulSimon.addSong('Cecilia')
  //=> Paul Simon has written 'Cecilia'
       undefined

paulSimon.songs()
  //=> [ 'Cecilia' ]
~~~~~~~~

Why would we do this? Well, for certain styles of programming, we care very much what prototypes are in an object's prototype chain. Note:

~~~~~~~~
AwardWinningSongwriter.isPrototypeOf(sweetBabyJames)
  //=> false

AwardWinningSongwriter.isPrototypeOf(paulSimon)
  //=> true
~~~~~~~~

When we compose behaviours directly, we lose the ability to track their inclusion in the prototype chain. There is no baked-in way to ask whether an object includes the behaviour from `AwardWinningSongwriter`. So why don't we *always* wire behaviours up with prototype chains? As we discussed earlier, prototype chains can only model trees, while composing behaviours provides much more freedom to mix and match compact, focused responsibilities.

When we choose model our behaviour with prototypes, it is still advantageous to use our model for composing behaviour. A naïve prototype chain with methods embedded directly in the prototypes has open recursion and suffers from coupling. Using encapsulated behaviours with prototypes decouples prototypes from the object and from each other.
