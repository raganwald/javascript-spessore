## Encapsulation for Metaobjects {#encapsulation-for-metaobjects}

Encapsulation is not just a domain object concern. Lack of encapsulation also affects the relationship between metaobjects. When two or more metaobjects all have access to the same base object via [open recursion][or], they become tightly coupled because they can interact via setting and reading all the base object's properties. It is impossible to restrict their interaction to a well-defined set of methods.

A> Encapsulation was a revolutionary idea in the 1980s when Smalltalk launched, and accepted as standard practice in the 1990s when Java rose to prominence. It is now a well-known design imperative. Paradoxically, that means that it often is not necessary to impose strict limitations on objects' abilities to interact with each other's internal state, because programmers are much less likely to attempt it today than they were in the 1980s when `C` was the popular language and manipulating structs was the popular paradigm.

This coupling exists for all metaobject patterns that include open recursion, such as mixins, delegation, and delegation through naive prototypes.

In particular, when chains of naive prototypes form [class hierarchies][ch], this coupling leads to the [fragile base class problem][fbc].

![A class hierarchy](images/tree.png)

K> The **fragile base class problem** is a fundamental architectural problem of object-oriented programming systems where base classes (superclasses) are considered "fragile" because seemingly safe modifications to a base class, when inherited by the derived classes, may cause the derived classes to malfunction. The programmer cannot determine whether a base class change is safe simply by examining in isolation the methods of the base class.--[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragile_base_class)

In JavaScript, prototype chains are vulnerable because changes to one prototype's behaviour may break another prototype's behaviour in the same chain.

In this decade, we are much more worried about metaobjects becoming coupled than we are about objects. As we discussed [earlier](#encapsulation-problem), when introducing the private mixins and forwarding, metaobjects quickly become coupled because of [open recursion][or].

[or]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_recursion#Open_recursion

By default, metaobjects like prototypes are tightly coupled to each other because they all manipulate their base object's properties. And while it is a more difficult problem to solve technically than the problem of coupling peer objects, it is more important to solve it because the problem is more widespread.

Like it or not, many programmers who are perfectly aware that objects should not manipulate each other's internal state will be surprised to learn that having "classes" manipulate an object's internal state has exactly the same consequences.

If we can find a way to manage the interface between an object and a metaobject, we can make our programs more robust and discourage others from carelessly introducing coupling.

### inner proxies

Our original proxy wrapped around an object, presenting an interface to the "outside world:"

![A proxy](images/7/proxy.png)

An object or function can also create its own proxy around an object:

![A proxy](images/7/inner_proxy.png)

Here's one way to use this. Recall our utility for creating a private mixin:

![extendPrivately](images/7/extendPrivately.png)

Note the highlighted expression. Every method we mix in shares the same new, empty object as its context. This separates them completely from the properties of any object they're mixed into.

Let's start with our code for creating proxies:

~~~~~~~~
function proxy (baseObject, optionalPrototype) {
  var proxyObject = Object.create(optionalPrototype || null),
      methodName;
  for (methodName in baseObject) {
    if (typeof(baseObject[methodName]) ===  'function') {
      (function (methodName) {
        proxyObject[methodName] = function () {
          var result = baseObject[methodName].apply(baseObject, arguments);
          return (result === baseObject)
                 ? proxyObject
                 : result;
        }
      })(methodName);
    }
  }
  return proxyObject;
}
~~~~~~~~

But now, let's rewrite the way we do "private" inheritance:

~~~~~~~~
function extendWithProxy (baseObject, behaviour) {
  var methodName,
      context = proxy(baseObject);

  for (methodName in behaviour) {
    if (behaviour.hasOwnProperty(methodName)) {
      baseObject[methodName] = behaviour[methodName].bind(context);
    };
  };
  return baseObject;
}
~~~~~~~~

Instead of extending an object with methods that only have access to a private object for holding their own state, we're extending an object with methods that have access to their own private state *and* to the methods of the object.

For example:

~~~~~~~~
var Person = {
  fullName: function () {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  },
  rename: function (first, last) {
    this.firstName = first;
    this.lastName = last;
    return this;
  }
};

var HasCareer = {
  career: function () {
    return this.chosenCareer;
  },
  setCareer: function (career) {
    this.chosenCareer = career;
    return this;
  },
  describe: function () {
    return this.fullName() + " is a " + this.chosenCareer;
  }
};

var samwise = {};

extendWithProxy(samwise, Person);
extendWithProxy(samwise, HasCareer);

samwise
  //=>
    { fullName: [Function],
      rename: [Function],
      career: [Function],
      setCareer: [Function],
      describe: [Function] }
~~~~~~~~

Our new object has all the methods of both `Person` and `HasCareer`. Let's try it:

~~~~~~~~
samwise.rename('Sam', 'Wise')
samwise
  //=>
    { fullName: [Function],
      rename: [Function],
      career: [Function],
      setCareer: [Function],
      describe: [Function] }

samwise.setCareer('Companion');
samwise.describe()
  //=> 'Sam Wise is a Companion'
~~~~~~~~

Our `describe` method has access to `HasCareer`'s private internal state and to `samwise`'s `fullName` method.

### an off-topic refinement

If you're "playing along at home," you may have noticed this:

~~~~~~~~
samwise.setCareer('Companion');
  //=>
    { fullName: [Function],
      rename: [Function],
      chosenCareer: 'Companion' }
~~~~~~~~

The problem is that the `setCareer` method returns `this`, but when extended privately or encapsualtedly (we are making up words), `this` is the private state of the mixin, not the original object or its proxy.

There are fixes for this. For example:

~~~~~~~~
function extendWithProxy (baseObject, behaviour) {
  var methodName,
      context = proxy(baseObject);

  for (methodName in behaviour) {
    if (behaviour.hasOwnProperty(methodName)) {
      (function (methodName) {
        baseObject[methodName] = function () {
          var result = behaviour[methodName].apply(context, arguments);
          return (result === context) ? baseObject : result;
        };
      })(methodName);
    };
  };
  return baseObject;
}

var pepys = {};

extendWithProxy(pepys, Person);
extendWithProxy(pepys, HasCareer);

pepys.rename('Samuel', 'Pepys');
  //=>
    { fullName: [Function],
      rename: [Function],
      career: [Function],
      setCareer: [Function],
      describe: [Function] }

pepys.setCareer('Diarist');
  //=>
    { fullName: [Function],
      rename: [Function],
      career: [Function],
      setCareer: [Function],
      describe: [Function] }

pepys.describe();
  //=> 'Samuel Pepys is a Diarist'
~~~~~~~~

### proxies and prototypes

Let's try using our `extendWithProxy` function with a singleton prototype:

~~~~~~~~
var prototype = {};

extendWithProxy(prototype, Person);
extendWithProxy(prototype, HasCareer);

var michael = Object.create(prototype);

michael.rename('Michael', 'Sam');
michael.fullName()
  //=> 'Michael Sam'
~~~~~~~~

So far, so good. Now let's use a *shared* prototype:

~~~~~~~~
var Careerist = {};

extendWithProxy(Careerist, Person);
extendWithProxy(Careerist, HasCareer);

var michael    = Object.create(Careerist),
    betwitched = Object.create(Careerist);

michael.rename('Michael', 'Sam');
betwitched.rename('Samantha', 'Stephens');

michael.fullName()
  //=> 'Samantha Stephens'
~~~~~~~~

Bzzzzzzzt! This does not work because each of our "encapsulated" mixins hash its own private state, but they are mixed into the shared prototype, so therefore the private state is shared as well.

### safekeeping for shared prototypes {#safekeeping-shared-prototypes}

This is the same problem we solved with [safekeeping for private mixins](#safekeeping-for-private-mixins). Private mixin place the private state in an object shared by the methods in the mixin. But when the methods are mixed into a shared prototype, every object that delegates to those methods is sharing the methods, and this sharing that one shared state.

So we'll rewrite `extendWithProxy` to place the proxy in safekeeping:

~~~~~~~~
var number = 0;

function extendWithProxy (baseObject, behaviour) {
  var safekeepingName = "__" + ++number + "__",
      methodName;

  for (methodName in behaviour) {
    if (behaviour.hasOwnProperty(methodName)) {
      (function (methodName) {
        baseObject[methodName] = function () {
          var context = this[safekeepingName],
              result;
          if (context == null) {
            context = proxy(this);
            Object.defineProperty(this, safekeepingName, {
              enumerable: false,
              writable: false,
              value: context
            });
          }
          result = behaviour[methodName].apply(context, arguments);
          return (result === context) ? this : result;
        };
      })(methodName);
    };
  };
  return baseObject;
}
~~~~~~~~

As with private mixins, we are storing the context in a hidden property within the receiver. However, instead of just being an empty object, the context is now a proxy for the receiver. Thus, every mixed-in method has access to all of the receiver's methods as well as state shared between the methods being mixed in.

Let's try it, we'll create a shared prototype called `Careerist`, and we'll mix in `HasName` and `HasCareer`. To make sure everything works as expected, we'll use two different objects delegating to `Careerist`, and we'll make sure that both `HasName` and `HasCareer` both try to modify the `name` property.

Unlike previous examples, however, we'll add a third mixin that relies on the methods from the other two:

~~~~~~~~
var HasName = {
  name: function () {
    return this.name;
  },
  setName: function (name) {
    this.name = name;
    return this;
  }
};

var HasCareer = {
  career: function () {
    return this.name;
  },
  setCareer: function (name) {
    this.name = name;
    return this;
  }
};

var IsSelfDescribing = {
  description: function () {
    return this.name() + ' is a ' + this.career();
  }
};

var Careerist = {};

extendWithProxy(Careerist, HasName);
extendWithProxy(Careerist, HasCareer);
extendWithProxy(Careerist, IsSelfDescribing);

var michael    = Object.create(Careerist),
    bewitched = Object.create(Careerist);

michael.setName('Michael Sam');
bewitched.setName('Samantha Stephens');

michael.setCareer('Athlete');
bewitched.setCareer('Thaumaturge');

michael.description()
  //=> 'Michael Sam is a Athlete'
bewitched.description()
  //=> 'Samantha Stephens is a Thaumaturge'
~~~~~~~~

`IsSelfDescribing` has its own private state, but it is also able to call `.name` and `.career` on the receiver because its private state is also a proxy.

This version of `extendWithProxy` is a superset of the behaviour of private mixins. It has more moving parts, but mixins that don't want to call any methods on the receiver needn't call any methods on the receiver.
