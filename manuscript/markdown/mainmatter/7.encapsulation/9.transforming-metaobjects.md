## Transforming Metaobjects

Going back to the [Big Idea](#big-idea), there is value in having an algebra of metaobjects. We've just seen a protocol for encapsulating and composing metaobjects: Encapsulation works with composition to decouple metaobjects from each other, which in turn makes it easy to combine and recombine them as needed to form new metaobjects.

Composition is not the only mechanism for building metaobjects from other metaobjects. We can also *transform* metaobjects into new metaobjects. We've already seen one such transformation: `encapsulate` transformed an unencapsulated metaobject into an encpsulated metaobject.

Here's another function that transforms a metaobject into another metaobject:

~~~~~~~~
function fluentByDefault (metaobject) {
	var metaproto = Object.getPrototypeOf(metaobject),
	    fluentMetaobject = Object.create(metaproto),
	    key;

	for (key in metaobject) {
		if (typeof metaobject[key] === 'function') {
			!function (key) {
				fluentMetaobject[key] = function () {
					var returnValue = metaobject[key].apply(this, arguments);

					return typeof returnValue === 'undefined'
					       ? this
								 : returnValue;
				}
			}(key);
		}
	}
	return fluentMetaobject;
}
~~~~~~~~

This takes a metaobject and returns another metaobject. The new metaobject delegates all of its methods to the original, but its return value protocol is decorated: any method that returns `undefined` will return `this` instead.

Note that we are not modifying a metaobject in place. Consider:

~~~~~~~~
var Songwriter = encapsulate({
  initialize: function () {
    this._songs = [];
  },
  addSong: function (name) {
    this._songs.push(name);
  },
  songs: function () {
    return this._songs;
  }
});

var FluentSongwriter = fluentByDefault(Songwriter);

var hall  = Object.create(Songwriter),
    oates = Object.create(FluentSongwriter);

hall.initialize();
	//=> undefined
oates.initialize();
	//=> {}

hall.addSong("your kiss is on my list");
		//=> undefined
oates.addSong("your kiss is on my list");
	//=> {}
~~~~~~~~

Creating `FluentSongwriter` by transforming `Songwriter` does not modify `Songwriter`, it retains its behaviour and meaning. This differs from practice in some language communities, where it is commonplace to modify metaobjects in place. As we discussed in [Closing Encapsulated Objects](#closed), encapsulated objects like `Songwriter` cannot be modified in place, but a naïve metaobject could easily be mutated:

~~~~~~~~
var NaiveSongwriter = {
  initialize: function () {
    this._songs = [];
  },
  addSong: function (name) {
    this._songs.push(name);
  },
  songs: function () {
    return this._songs;
  }
};

// ...

var oldInitialize = NaiveSongwriter.initialize,
    oldAddSong    = NaiveSongwriter.addSong;

NaiveSongwriter.initialize = function () {
	oldInitialize.call(this);
	return this;
}

NaiveSongwriter.addSong = function (song) {
	oldAddSong.call(this, song);
	return this;
}
~~~~~~~~

This goes completely against the idea of an "algebra:" Modifying a metaobject couples the code that modifies the metaobject to every object that might use it. On a small scale this is manageable. But people have adopted this practice in languages like Ruby, and their experience with large-scale programs has produced decidedly mixed reviews.

On the whole, it is decidedly better to transform metaobjects by creating new metaobjects from them that may delegate to the original.

### manufacturing transformations

One of JavaScript's strengths is that it's straightforward to write one-off transformation functions like `fluentByDefault`. Other languages often bury their metaobject models inside their implementations nad make it difficult to write transformations. To compensate, other language communities often provide libraries that provide an abstraction for transforming metaobjects.

One popular abstraction goes back to Lisp Flavours and survives today in the [Common Lisp Object System][clos]: Methods have one "default" behaviour, but may have zero or more "before," "after," and "around" behaviours. Recall the way we composed a `SongWriter` with a `Subscribable`:

[clos]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp_Object_System

~~~~~~~~
var Songwriter = encapsulate({
  initialize: function () {
    this._songs = [];
  },
  addSong: function (name) {
    this._songs.push(name);
  },
  songs: function () {
    return this._songs;
  }
});

var Subscribable = encapsulate({
  initialize: function () {
    this._subscribers = [];
    return this.self;
  },
  subscribe: function (callback) {
    this._subscribers.push(callback);
  },
  unsubscribe: function (callback) {
    this._subscribers = this._subscribers.filter( function (subscriber) {
      return subscriber !== callback;
    });
  },
  subscribers: function () {
    return this._subscribers;
  },
  notify: function () {
    receiver = this;
    this._subscribers.forEach( function (subscriber) {
      subscriber.apply(receiver.self, arguments);
    });
  }
});

var SubscribableSongWriter = composeMetaobjects(
  Songwriter,
  Subscribable,
  encapsulate({
    notify: undefined,
    addSong: function () { this.notify(); }
  })
);
~~~~~~~~

Although this example is small and easy to read, on a large scale, it can be a problem to use composition like this. There are three metaobjects being composed, but while the first and second are orthogonal peers, the third is really "glue" to write them together, it would never be used independently.

This is a good candidate for using a transformation, we'll use it to illustrate a "flavours-style" function.

~~~~~~~~
function flavour (base, transformation) {

}
