> “I think it’s one of the best tech books I’ve read since Sedgewick’s Algorithms in C.”--Andrey Sidorov

> “Your explanation of closures in JavaScript Allongé is the best I've read.”--Emehrkay

### allong.es

[allong.es] is a JavaScript library inspired by JavaScript Allongé. It contains many utility functions that are used in JavaScript Spessore's examples, such as `map`, `variadic` and `tap`.
