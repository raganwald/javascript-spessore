Welcome to [JavaScript Spessore][js]. This is a book about "Thinking in Objects," using JavaScript as the medium for discussion. The format of the book is as follows:

[Caffé Lungo](#lungo) revisits the discussion of objects, prototypes, and delegation from the book [JavaScript Allongé][ja]. This gives up a grounding in what JavaScript provides "out of the box" and how people typically apply it.

[The Object's The Thing](#object) examines JavaScript's objects and properties more closely, with an emphasis on using defined properties to control an object's interface.

[Methods](#methods) expands on the notion of a method, looking at constructing composite methods, method objects, and meta-methods.

In [The Big Idea](#big-idea), we will look at an oft-overlooked central idea of object-oriented programming: That *everything* can be encapsulated, not just entities we intuitively call "objects."

We'll dive into the notion of [Metaobjects](#metaobjects), objects that define the behaviour of other objects.
